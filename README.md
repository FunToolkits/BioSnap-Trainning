## FAQ

### Why is the source code copyrighted?

We wanted to limit the redistribution of the project, since it is going to be hosted on the Play Store, and we wanted to be able to obtain funds from users so that we can continue developing our projects, so we are going to host a free version with Ads and a paid version without any Ads, we hope you understand.

### So, Why is it on Github?

We believe in transparency, privacy and respecting the anonymity of our users, which is why we provide all the code here to be reviewed, and we believe in co-creation, as we are a small organization that aims to carry out fun but impactful projects, our ability to analyze problems in the source code, solve bugs, improve performance, as well as have ideas that add to the project are very limited, apart from the fact that a user's perspective often differs from that of the project creator, in addition to the different points of view that a joint creation can provide as opposed to a solo creation.

### How to make a contribution?

We have the file `contribution.md` describing the whole process, even if you don't code, you still can make a contribution by give suggestion and voting for them, as other forms of contribution that are beyond just coding, the details are in that file.
